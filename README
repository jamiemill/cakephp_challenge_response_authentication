A plugin containing a replacement for cake's AuthComponent that provides javascript challenge-response password authentication.

What does it do?

- For login, it uses javascript to hash the user's password with a pseudo-nonce (the "challenge" from the server, based on a random string and the current time) and sends the hashed password instead of the plaintext password for the server to compare with the same process.

Why would you use this?

- The only reason to use this is avoid passwords being sent in plain text over the internet
- If for some reason you can't implement SSL this may be slightly useful, but you probably have other problems (cookie sniffing and hijacking for instance)
- If you have SSL then this can provide a small extra layer of protection in the case that the user was tricked by a spoofed certificate, because the user never sends the actual password.

Disadvantages

- The password must still be sent in the clear for registration and password reset requests so the server can update its records
- Your application's security salt will be revealed to all visitors who see the login form, as this is required for the hashing to be done client-side
- Automatic password hashing in the controller is disabled, so to save new passwords you must manually hash it first.
